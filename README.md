# Dapp-Frontend

### Overview
I built the frontend for my decentralized application (Dapp) using ReactJS. The frontend interacts with the smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to seamlessly engage with the decentralized features of my application. With Web3.js integration, I've enabled communication between the frontend and the blockchain, ensuring smooth data flow and transaction execution. Metamask integration further enhances user experience by providing secure access to the Ethereum network directly from the browser.

### Dependencies
To run the frontend, you'll need:

1. ReactJS
2. Web3.js
3. Metamask

### Installation
1. Install dependencies using NPM.
2. Connect Metamask to the Ethereum blockchain.

### Usage
1. Set up Web3.js to allow the frontend to communicate with the blockchain.
2. Initialize contracts to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
3. Render the contents onto the webpage.
4. Additional features such as tasks, payments, and rewards management can be implemented.
